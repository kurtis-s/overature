Description: Simplifies MCMC setup by automatically looping through sampling 
    functions and saving the results.  Reduces memory footprint of running MCMC 
    and saves samples to disk as the chain runs.  Allows samples from the chain
    to be analyzed while the MCMC is still running.  Provides functions for 
    commonly performed operations such as calculating Metropolis acceptance 
    ratios and creating adaptive Metropolis samplers.
